# Physics-Masters-Project
Contains my work for my astrophysics master's project based on supernova cosmology. This was a heavily data analysis driven project so I have uploaded some files here to demonstrate my abilities.
Including: Pdf and latex source code for my final report/thesis; A folder containing all figures I created for the project; Python source code for several figures to demonstrate data analysis skills; Python source code for the machine learning algorithm using bayesian statistics (MCMC) used in this project.
