# Physics-Masters-Project
This folder contains all the work from my research project that I successfully completed to gain my master's degree in astrophysics. This is to demonstrate all the coding and data analysis skills I have gained.

Firstly, a pdf of my master's project report/thesis and a zip file containing the latex source for the document is incldued for reference and to provide context on the project. A poster which summarises the project is also included.

There is also a folder containting PNG image files of all the figures (graphs and plots etc.) I created for my reasearch project. These were all created with python code using real data collected by a telescope at the Mt Palomar Observatory. These images demonsrate my skills in data visualisation and how I successfully manipulated large amounts of data to create excellent quality scientific plots.

Python code for a selection of the figures from the report is inlcuded to show my proficiency in using python code for data analysis. All the plots were made using the python library "matplotlib". I also utilised the "Pandas" library to covert the csv data in to pandas dataframes for easier manipulation. The python file "utilities_" contains all the functions I wrote for common procedures. This file is to be used in conjunction with the main code files for each figure. Any functions needed are imported into the main file. 

The python code for Figure 4 demonstrates my ability to perform linear regressions on data. The code for Figures 4 and 7 show how I added binned averages to make the plots easier to interpret. Figure 7 also demonstrates how I can fit unconventional models to data such as a step function. Figure 8 shows my ability to include a 3rd variable as a colour gradient for deeper analysis into underlying relationships between variables. 

The code for Figure 11 shows how I successfully performed a hypothesis test using a statistical distrubtion test called a "K-S test" and presented the distribtions in the form of histograms. 

Finally, the file named Simultaneous Fitting (MCMC) shows how I successfully used a machine learning algorithm known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) which uses bayesian statistics to search through all the data simultaneously. This was used to account for underlying relationsips between variables. For more context on how this was used for my project please refer to my masters thesis document.
